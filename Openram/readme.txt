========================

The Repo contains SRAM2x16 and SRAM32x256 sample memory generated using openram compiler.

This is an ongoing work which has lots of issues in the designs. Repo will be updated upon improvements time to time.

Note: Only "Openram" folder of the repo is updating, other stuffs are perfectly working. Upon completion entire repo will be updated with new designs.

=========
# Updates

 * Inside Openram folder, contains updated layouts for openram compiler which are yet to be finalised.
 * SRAM bit cell is optimised would not give DRC issues with openram.( Correct me if you find any, will look into it)

# Known Issues
=========
 * DRC Issues 
 * Other Custom cells yet to be optimised
